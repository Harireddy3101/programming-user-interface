        <h3>Project 1 : Rental management System</h3>
        <p>Our Project is regarding Rental management system where owner who wish to rent out their furnished property and a client who required furnished properties for a fixed period. We create a database for client where they can check their advance payment, lease details, monthly rent, gas bills, electricity bills and laundry bills. We will create a simple login interface for the client to look at their monthly bills. The payment method and details will be maintained in the database. The billing invoices will be generated to client mails. Using this database management system client can find all their residential bills at a place which is easy to access.</p>

        <h3>Project 2 : Implementation OF IOT in HealthCare</h3>
        <p>The past few decades have witnessed a significant increase in life expectancy, resulting in a growing population of elderly individuals living independently. However, this demographic often faces challenges related to mobility difficulties, symptoms of dementia, and other health issues, necessitating support and assistance. In response, this paper proposes an innovative Internet of Things (IoT)-based information system tailored to meet the indoor and outdoor needs of such individuals. Acknowledging a deficiency in methodological approaches to the design process identified through a comprehensive survey of related works, we introduce a robust Design Methodology (DM) that considers the perspectives of stakeholders, contracting authorities, and potential users. This comprehensive approach ensures that the resulting solution addresses the diverse needs and requirements of all involved parties.</p>

        <h3>Project 3 : Guardian Eye</h3>
        <p>The feasibility study assesses the viability of implementing an intelligent security camera system with object detection capabilities for efficient emergency response. The project aims to revolutionize traditional surveillance systems by enabling real-time threat detection and immediate alerts to first responders. Through comprehensive analysis, this document evaluates the technical, financial, operational, legal, and environmental feasibility of the proposed system.</p>
